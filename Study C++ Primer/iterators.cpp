/*

*iter - Returns a reference to the element denoted by the iterator iter
iter->mem - Derefence Iter and fetches the member named mem from the underlying elemenet
         (*iter).mem
++iter -> Increment iter to refer to the next element in the container
--iter -> Decrement iter to refer to previous element in the container
iter1 == iter2
iter1 != iter2 Compares two iterators for equality (inequality). Two iterators are
               equal if the denote the same element or if they are the off-the-end
               iterator for the same container.
